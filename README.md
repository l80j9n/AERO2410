1   INTRODUCTION
An introduction can:
·   state the   purpose   of the report
·   set the   context   and   background   of the problem, issue or investigation
o   may include an outline of the sections so that the reader understands the structure
Write your Introductory comments here. Use “Normal” style. for the main text. Text should be justified to both LH and RH margins. “Heading 1” and “Heading 2” Styles are used for the headers if you need to add more. The numbering should follow automatically.
I recommend you use “page breaks” to assist in formatting your work.
2   MAIN BODYWhenever you include a graph/diagram/figure, you must include a Figure number and Caption centred beneath the item. (Also include a reference source). I recommend using MS Word’s REFERENCES/Insert Caption as the best way of doing this. Then, in the text, simply use INSERT/Cross reference to refer to your item.

Whenever you include a table, you must include a Table number and Caption centred above the item. Again, I recommend using MS Word’s REFERENCES/Insert Caption as the best way of doing this. Then, in the text, simply use INSERT/Cross reference to refer to your item
3   CONCLUSIONS
3.1   Conclusion sub-heading (if required)
Immediately following the conclusion, you must include a word count statement in the format:
Word Count = xxxx words. (where xxxx   is the total number of words in your assignment, excluding the references and ToC).
4   REFERENCESThe reference section must be started on a new page. All references must be presented in Harvard Style. If you are unsure what Harvard Style. means, please see the Harvard Style. Guideline document about this. Make sure your predominant reference sources are from journals, books, Annual reports, official airline webpages and industry periodicals.   
Save your work as an MS Word document AND as a pdf document. Only the pdf document should be submitted to Turnitin for assessment.
